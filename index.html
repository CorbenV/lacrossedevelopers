        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This thing is just starting to get going.  The plan is to get a meetup group going for local developers, students, etc. to get together semi-regularly to chat, eventually hold mini tech talks, etc.  We developers are relatively few in this part of the state, so let's band together.</p>
        <p>There's some more detailed info about the idea <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/d7w2o6/any_software_developers_in_the_area_interested_in/">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p><strong>First meetup was held November 7th, 2019.</strong>  Only three of us this time around, but we had a good discussion and started planning the future of the group.</p>
        <p><strong>Second meetup</strong> is planned for Thursday, February 6, 2020 at 6:30pm at the south side's Goodwill in the community room.  Join us in Discord for more information.</p>

        <h3>Discord</h3>
