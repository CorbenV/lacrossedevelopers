        <p>This is a fairly new group that started in the fall of 2019.  We are a laid-back group of programmers, entrepreneuers, tech enthusiasts, and game developers who hang out, discuss technology.  We welcome everyone, from experienced programmers, to students, to people who aren't into programming but enjoy technology.</p>
