        <h2>(better website coming "soon"...)</h2>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This is a fairly new group that started in the fall of 2019.  We are a laid-back group of programmers, entrepreneuers and tech enthusiasts who hang out, discuss technology.  We welcome everyone, from experienced programmers, to students, to people who aren't into programming but enjoy technology.</p>
        <p>There's some more detailed info about the idea <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lacrossewi/comments/d7w2o6/any_software_developers_in_the_area_interested_in/">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Past events</h3>
        <p><strong>First meetup was held November 7th, 2019.</strong>  Only three of us this time around, but we had a good discussion and started planning the future of the group.</p>
        <p><strong>Second meetup</strong> was held on Thursday, February 6, 2020 at 6:30pm at the south side's Goodwill in the community room.</p>
        <p><strong>Third meetup</strong> was held Sunday, February 23, 2020 at 2:00pm at the Onalaska Goodwill in the community room.</p>

        <p><strong>Meetings temporarily on hold</strong> due to shutdowns and things.  Things will get back to 100% whenever society gets back to normal.  The Discord's still active in the meantime; see below.</p>
